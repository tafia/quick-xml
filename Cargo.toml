## Enables support for asynchronous reading from `tokio`'s IO-Traits by enabling
## [reading events] from types implementing [`tokio::io::AsyncBufRead`].
##
## [reading events]: crate::reader::Reader::read_event_into_async
async-tokio = ["tokio"]

## Enables support of non-UTF-8 encoded documents. Encoding will be inferred from
## the XML declaration if it will be found, otherwise UTF-8 is assumed.
##
## Currently, only ASCII-compatible encodings are supported, so, for example,
## UTF-16 will not work (therefore, `quick-xml` is not [standard compliant]).
##
## List of supported encodings includes all encodings supported by [`encoding_rs`]
## crate, that satisfied the restriction above.
##
## [standard compliant]: https://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/#charencoding
encoding = ["encoding_rs"]

## Enables support for recognizing all [HTML 5 entities] in [`unescape`] and
## [`unescape_with`] functions. The full list of entities also can be found in
## <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/entities.json>.

## This feature for a serde deserializer that enables support for deserializing
## lists where tags are overlapped with tags that do not correspond to the list.
##
## When this feature is enabled, the XML:
## ```xml
## <any-name>
##   <item/>
##   <another-item/>
##   <item/>
##   <item/>
## </any-name>
## ```
## could be deserialized to a struct:
## ```no_run
## # use serde::Deserialize;
## #[derive(Deserialize)]
## #[serde(rename_all = "kebab-case")]
## struct AnyName {
##   item: Vec<()>,
##   another_item: (),
## }
## ```
##
## When this feature is not enabled (default), only the first element will be
## associated with the field, and the deserialized type will report an error
## (duplicated field) when the deserializer encounters a second `<item/>`.
##
## Note, that enabling this feature can lead to high and even unlimited memory
## consumption, because deserializer should check all events up to the end of a
## container tag (`</any-name>` in that example) to figure out that there are no
## more items for a field. If `</any-name>` or even EOF is not encountered, the
## parsing will never end which can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) scenario.
##
## Having several lists and overlapped elements for them in XML could also lead
## to quadratic parsing time, because the deserializer must check the list of
## events as many times as the number of sequence fields present in the schema.
##
## To reduce negative consequences, always [limit] the maximum number of events
## that [`Deserializer`] will buffer.
##
## This feature works only with `serialize` feature and has no effect if `serialize`
## is not enabled.
