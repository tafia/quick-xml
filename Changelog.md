## 0.32.0 -- 2024-06-10

The way to configure parser is changed. Now all configuration is contained in the
`Config` struct and can be applied at once. When `serde-types` feature is enabled,
configuration is serializable.

The method of reporting positions of errors has changed - use `error_position()`
to get an offset of the error position. For `SyntaxError`s the range
`error_position()..buffer_position()` also will represent a span of error.

The way of resolve entities with `unescape_with` are changed. Those methods no longer
resolve predefined entities.

### New Features

- [#513]: Allow to continue parsing after getting new `Error::IllFormed`.
- [#677]: Added methods `config()` and `config_mut()` to inspect and change the parser
  configuration. Previous builder methods on `Reader` / `NsReader` was replaced by
  direct access to fields of config using `reader.config_mut().<...>`.
- [#684]: Added a method `Config::enable_all_checks` to turn on or off all
  well-formedness checks.
- [#362]: Added `escape::minimal_escape()` which escapes only `&` and `<`.
- [#362]: Added `BytesCData::minimal_escape()` which escapes only `&` and `<`.
- [#362]: Added `Serializer::set_quote_level()` which allow to set desired level of escaping.
- [#705]: Added `NsReader::prefixes()` to list all the prefixes currently declared.
- [#629]: Added a default case to `impl_deserialize_for_internally_tagged_enum` macro so that
  it can handle every attribute that does not match existing cases within an enum variant.
- [#722]: Allow to pass owned strings to `Writer::create_element`. This is breaking change!
- [#275]: Added `ElementWriter::new_line()` which enables pretty printing elements with multiple attributes.
- [#743]: Added `Deserializer::get_ref()` to get XML Reader from serde Deserializer
- [#734]: Added helper functions to resolve predefined XML and HTML5 entities:
  - `quick_xml::escape::resolve_predefined_entity`
  - `quick_xml::escape::resolve_xml_entity`
  - `quick_xml::escape::resolve_html5_entity`
- [#753]: Added parser for processing instructions: `quick_xml::reader::PiParser`.
- [#754]: Added parser for elements: `quick_xml::reader::ElementParser`.

### Bug Fixes

- [#622]: Fix wrong disregarding of not closed markup, such as lone `<`.
- [#684]: Fix incorrect position reported for `Error::IllFormed(DoubleHyphenInComment)`.
- [#684]: Fix incorrect position reported for `Error::IllFormed(MissingDoctypeName)`.
- [#704]: Fix empty tags with attributes not being expanded when `expand_empty_elements` is set to true.
- [#683]: Use local tag name when check tag name against possible names for field.
- [#753]: Correctly determine end of processing instructions and XML declaration.

### Misc Changes

- [#675]: Minimum supported version of serde raised to 1.0.139
- [#675]: Rework the `quick_xml::Error` type to provide more accurate information:
  - `Error::EndEventMismatch` replaced by `IllFormedError::MismatchedEndTag` in some cases
  - `Error::EndEventMismatch` replaced by `IllFormedError::UnmatchedEndTag` in some cases
  - `Error::TextNotFound` was removed because not used
  - `Error::UnexpectedBang` replaced by `SyntaxError`
  - `Error::UnexpectedEof` replaced by `SyntaxError` in some cases
  - `Error::UnexpectedEof` replaced by `IllFormedError` in some cases
  - `Error::UnexpectedToken` replaced by `IllFormedError::DoubleHyphenInComment`
  - `Error::XmlDeclWithoutVersion` replaced by `IllFormedError::MissingDeclVersion` (in [#684])
  - `Error::EmptyDocType` replaced by `IllFormedError::MissingDoctypeName` (in [#684])
- [#684]: Changed positions reported for `SyntaxError`s: now they are always points
  to the start of markup (i. e. to the `<` character) with error. Use `error_position()`
  for that.
- [#684]: Now `<??>` parsed as `Event::PI` with empty content instead of raising
  syntax error.
- [#684]: Now `<?xml?>` parsed as `Event::Decl` instead of `Event::PI`.
- [#362]: Now default quote level is `QuoteLevel::Partial` when using serde serializer.
- [#689]: `buffer_position()` now always report the position the parser last seen.
  To get an error position use `error_position()`.
- [#738]: Add an example of how to deserialize XML elements into Rust enums using an
  intermediate custom deserializer.
- [#748]: Implement `Clone` for [`DeEvent`], [`PayloadEvent`] and [`Text`].
- [#734]: Rename `NoEntityResolver` to `PredefinedEntityResolver`.
- [#734]: No longer resolve predefined entities (`lt`, `gt`, `apos`, `quot`, `amp`)
  in `unescape_with` family of methods. You should do that by yourself using the methods
  listed above.

## 0.31.0 -- 2023-10-22

MSRV bumped to 1.56! Crate now uses Rust 2021 edition.

Enum representation was changed (it was buggy anyway) to ensure compatibility with
serde >= 1.0.181

### New Features

- [#545]: Resolve well-known namespaces (`xml` and `xmlns`) to their appropriate URIs.
  Also, enforce namespace constraints related to these well-known namespaces.
- [#635]: Add support for async `ElementWriter` operations.

### Bug Fixes

- [#660]: Fixed incorrect deserialization of `xs:list`s from empty tags (`<tag/>`
  or `<tag></tag>`). Previously an `DeError::UnexpectedEof")` was returned in that case
- [#580]: Fixed incorrect deserialization of vectors of newtypes from sequences of tags.
- [#661]: More string handling of serialized primitive values (booleans, numbers, strings,
  unit structs, unit variants). `<int>123<something-else/></int>` is no longer valid
  content. Previously all data after `123` up to closing tag would be silently skipped.
- [#567]: Fixed incorrect deserialization of vectors of enums from sequences of tags.
- [#671]: Fixed deserialization of empty `simpleType`s (for example, attributes) into
  `Option` fields: now they are always deserialized as `Some("")`.

### Misc Changes

- [#643]: Bumped MSRV to 1.56. In practice the previous MSRV was incorrect in many cases.
- [#643]: Adopted Rust 2021 edition.
- [#545]: Added new `Error` variant -- `Error::InvalidPrefixBind`.
- [#651]: Relax requirement for version of `arbitrary` dependency -- we're actually
  compatible with version 1.0.0 and up.
- [#649]: Make features linkable and reference them in the docs.
- [#619]: Allow to raise application errors in `ElementWriter::write_inner_content`
  (and newly added `ElementWriter::write_inner_content_async` of course).
- [#662]: Get rid of some allocations during serde deserialization.
- [#665]: Improve serialization of `xs:list`s when some elements serialized to an empty string.
- [#630]: Fixed compatibility with serde >= 1.0.181

## 0.30.0 -- 2023-07-23

### New Features

- [#609]: Added `Writer::write_serializable` to provide the capability to serialize
  arbitrary types using serde when using the lower-level `Writer` API.
- [#615]: Added ability to set entity resolver when deserialize using borrowing reader.
- [#617]: Added ability to enforce the expansion of empty elements.

### Bug Fixes

- [#604]: Avoid crashing on wrong comments like `<!-->` when using `read_event_into*` functions.

## 0.29.0 -- 2023-06-13

### New Features

- [#601]: Add `serde_helper` module to the crate root with some useful utility
  functions and document using of enum's unit variants as a text content of element.
- [#606]: Implement indentation for `AsyncWrite` trait implementations.

### Bug Fixes

- [#603]: Fix a regression from [#581] that an XML comment or a processing
  instruction between a <!DOCTYPE> and the root element in the file broke
  deserialization of structs by returning `DeError::ExpectedStart`
- [#608]: Return a new error `Error::EmptyDocType` on empty doctype instead
  of crashing because of a debug assertion.

### Misc Changes

- [#594]: Add a helper macro to help deserialize internally tagged enums
  with Serde, which doesn't work out-of-the-box due to serde limitations.

## 0.28.2 -- 2023-04-12

### New Features

- [#581]: Allow `Deserializer` to set `quick_xml::de::EntityResolver` for
  resolving unknown entities that would otherwise cause the parser to return
  an [`EscapeError::UnrecognizedSymbol`] error.

### Misc Changes

- [#584]: Export `EscapeError` from the crate
- [#581]: Relax requirements for `unsescape_*` set of functions -- their now use
  `FnMut` instead of `Fn` for `resolve_entity` parameters, like `Iterator::map`
  from `std`.

[#581]: https://github.com/tafia/quick-xml/pull/581
[#584]: https://github.com/tafia/quick-xml/pull/584


## 0.28.1 -- 2023-03-19

### Misc Changes

- [#579]: `ElementWriter.write_inner_content` now uses a `FnOnce` instead of a more restrictive `Fn` closure

[#579]: https://github.com/tafia/quick-xml/pull/579


## 0.28.0 -- 2023-03-13

### New Features

- [#541]: (De)serialize specially named `$text` enum variant in [externally tagged]
  enums to / from textual content
- [#556]: `to_writer` and `to_string` now accept `?Sized` types
- [#556]: Add new `to_writer_with_root` and `to_string_with_root` helper functions
- [#520]: Add methods `BytesText::inplace_trim_start` and `BytesText::inplace_trim_end`
  to trim leading and trailing spaces from text events
- [#565]: Allow deserialize special field names `$value` and `$text` into borrowed
  fields when use serde deserializer
- [#568]: Rename `Writer::inner` into `Writer::get_mut`
- [#568]: Add method `Writer::get_ref`
- [#569]: Rewrite the `Reader::read_event_into_async` as an async fn, making the future `Send` if possible.
- [#571]: Borrow element names (`<element>`) when deserialize with serde.
  This change allow to deserialize into `HashMap<&str, T>`, for example
- [#573]: Add basic support for async byte writers via tokio's `AsyncWrite`.

### Bug Fixes

- [#537]: Restore ability to deserialize attributes that represents XML namespace
  mappings (`xmlns:xxx`) that was broken since [#490]
- [#510]: Fix an error of deserialization of `Option<T>` fields where `T` is some
  sequence type (for example, `Vec` or tuple)
- [#540]: Fix a compilation error (probably a rustc bug) in some circumstances.
  `Serializer::new` and `Serializer::with_root` now accepts only references to `Write`r.
- [#520]: Merge consequent (delimited only by comments and processing instructions)
  texts and CDATA when deserialize using serde deserializer. `DeEvent::Text` and
  `DeEvent::CData` events was replaced by `DeEvent::Text` with merged content.
  The same behavior for the `Reader` does not implemented (yet?) and should be
  implemented manually
- [#562]: Correctly set minimum required version of memchr dependency to 2.1
- [#565]: Correctly set minimum required version of tokio dependency to 1.10
- [#565]: Fix compilation error when build with serde <1.0.139

## 0.27.1 -- 2022-12-28

### Bug Fixes

- [#530]: Fix an infinite loop leading to unbounded memory consumption that occurs when
  skipping events on malformed XML with the `overlapped-lists` feature active.
- [#530]: Fix an error in the `Deserializer::read_to_end` when `overlapped-lists`
  feature is active and malformed XML is parsed

[#530]: https://github.com/tafia/quick-xml/pull/530


## 0.27.0 -- 2022-12-25

### New Features

- [#521]: Implement `Clone` for all error types. This required changing `Error::Io` to contain
  `Arc<std::io::Error>` instead of `std::io::Error` since `std::io::Error` does not implement
  `Clone`.

### Bug Fixes

- [#490]: Ensure that serialization of map keys always produces valid XML names.
  In particular, that means that maps with numeric and numeric-like keys (for
  example, `"42"`) no longer can be serialized because [XML name] cannot start
  from a digit
- [#500]: Fix deserialization of top-level sequences of enums, like
  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <!-- list of enum Enum { A, B, С } -->
  <A/>
  <B/>
  <C/>
  ```
- [#514]: Fix wrong reporting `Error::EndEventMismatch` after disabling and enabling
  `.check_end_names`
- [#517]: Fix swapped codes for `\r` and `\n` characters when escaping them
- [#523]: Fix incorrect skipping text and CDATA content before any map-like structures
  in serde deserializer, like
  ```xml
  unwanted text<struct>...</struct>
  ```
- [#523]: Fix incorrect handling of `xs:list`s with encoded spaces: they still
  act as delimiters, which is confirmed also by mature XmlBeans Java library
- [#473]: Fix a hidden requirement to enable serde's `derive` feature to get
  quick-xml's `serialize` feature for `edition = 2021` or `resolver = 2` crates

### Misc Changes

- [#490]: Removed `$unflatten=` special prefix for fields for serde (de)serializer, because:
  - it is useless for deserializer
  - serializer was rewritten and does not require it anymore

  This prefix allowed you to serialize struct field as an XML element and now
  replaced by a more thoughtful system explicitly indicating that a field should
  be serialized as an attribute by prepending `@` character to its name
- [#490]: Removed `$primitive=` prefix. That prefix allowed you to serialize struct
  field as an attribute instead of an element and now replaced by a more thoughtful
  system explicitly indicating that a field should be serialized as an attribute
  by prepending `@` character to its name
- [#490]: In addition to the `$value` special name for a field a new `$text`
  special name was added:
  - `$text` is used if you want to map field to text content only. No markup is
    expected (but text can represent a list as defined by `xs:list` type)
  - `$value` is used if you want to map elements with different names to one field,
    that should be represented either by an `enum`, or by sequence of `enum`s
    (`Vec`, tuple, etc.), or by string. Use it when you want to map field to any
    content of the field, text or markup

  Refer to [documentation] for details.
- [#521]: MSRV bumped to 1.52.
- [#473]: `serde` feature that used to make some types serializable, renamed to `serde-types`
- [#528]: Added documentation for XML to `serde` mapping

## 0.26.0 -- 2022-10-23

### Misc Changes

- [#481]: Removed the uses of `const fn` added in version 0.24 in favor of a lower minimum
  supported Rust version (1.46.0).  Minimum supported Rust version is now verified in the CI.
- [#489]: Reduced the size of the package uploaded into the crates.io by excluding
  tests, examples, and benchmarks.

- [#469]: Fix incorrect parsing of CDATA and comments when using buffered readers

[#469]: https://github.com/tafia/quick-xml/issues/469


## 0.24.0 -- 2022-08-28

### New Features

- [#387]: Allow overlapping between elements of sequence and other elements
  (using new feature `overlapped-lists`)
- [#393]: New module `name` with `QName`, `LocalName`, `Namespace`, `Prefix`
  and `PrefixDeclaration` wrappers around byte arrays and `ResolveResult` with
  the result of namespace resolution
- [#180]: Make `Decoder` struct public. You already had access to it via the
  `Reader::decoder()` method, but could not name it in the code. Now the preferred
  way to access decoding functionality is via this struct
- [#395]: Add support for XML Schema `xs:list`
- [#324]: `Reader::from_str` / `Deserializer::from_str` / `from_str` now ignore
  the XML declared encoding and always use UTF-8
- [#416]: Add `borrow()` methods in all event structs which allows to get
  a borrowed version of any event
- [#437]: Split out namespace reading functionality to a dedicated `NsReader`, namely:
  |Old function in `Reader`|New function in `NsReader`
  |------------------------|--------------------------
  |                        |`read_event` -- borrow from input
  |                        |`read_resolved_event` -- borrow from input
  |                        |`read_event_into`
  |`read_namespaced_event` |`read_resolved_event_into`
  |                        |`resolve`
  |`event_namespace`       |`resolve_element`
  |`attribute_namespace`   |`resolve_attribute`
- [#439]: Added utilities `detect_encoding()` and `decode()` under the `quick-xml::encoding` namespace.
- [#450]: Added support of asynchronous [tokio](https://tokio.rs/) readers
- [#455]: Change return type of all `read_to_end*` methods to return a span between tags
- [#455]: Added `Reader::read_text` method to return a raw content (including markup) between tags
- [#459]: Added a `Writer::write_bom()` method for inserting a Byte-Order-Mark into the document.
- [#467]: The following functions made `const`:
  - `Attr::key`
  - `Attr::value`
  - `Attributes::html`
  - `Attributes::new`
  - `BytesDecl::from_start`
  - `Decoder::encoding`
  - `LocalName::into_inner`
  - `Namespace::into_inner`
  - `Prefix::into_inner`
  - `QName::into_inner`
  - `Reader::buffer_position`
  - `Reader::decoder`
  - `Reader::get_ref`
  - `Serializer::new`
  - `Serializer::with_root`
  - `Writer::new`

### Bug Fixes

- [#9]: Deserialization erroneously was successful in some cases where error is expected.
  This broke deserialization of untagged enums which rely on error if variant cannot be parsed
- [#387]: Allow to have an ordinary elements together with a `$value` field
- [#387]: Internal deserializer state can be broken when deserializing a map with
  a sequence field (such as `Vec<T>`), where elements of this sequence contains
  another sequence. This error affects only users with the `serialize` feature enabled
- [#393]: Now `event_namespace`, `attribute_namespace` and `read_event_namespaced`
  returns `ResolveResult::Unknown` if prefix was not registered in namespace buffer
- [#393]: Fix breaking processing after encounter an attribute with a reserved name (started with "xmlns")
- [#363]: Do not generate empty `Event::Text` events
- [#412]: Fix using incorrect encoding if `read_to_end` family of methods or `read_text`
  method not found a corresponding end tag and reader has non-UTF-8 encoding
- [#421]: Fix incorrect order of unescape and decode operations for serde deserializer:
  decoding should be first, unescape is the second
- [#421]: Fixed unknown bug in serde deserialization of externally tagged enums
  when an enum variant represented as a `Text` event (i.e. `<xml>tag</xml>`)
  and a document encoding is not an UTF-8
- [#434]: Fixed incorrect error generated in some cases by serde deserializer
- [#445]: Use local name without namespace prefix when selecting enum variants based on element names
  in a serde deserializer

### Misc Changes

- [#8]: Changes in the error type `DeError`:
  |Variant|Change
  |-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------
  |~~`DeError::Text`~~|Removed because never raised
  |~~`DeError::InvalidEnum`~~|Removed because never raised
  |`DeError::Xml`|Renamed to `DeError::InvalidXml` for consistency with `DeError::InvalidBoolean`
  |`DeError::Int`|Renamed to `DeError::InvalidInt` for consistency with `DeError::InvalidBoolean`
  |`DeError::Float`|Renamed to `DeError::InvalidFloat` for consistency with `DeError::InvalidBoolean`
  |`DeError::Start`|Renamed to `DeError::UnexpectedStart` and tag name added to an error
  |`DeError::End`|Renamed to `DeError::UnexpectedEnd` and tag name added to an error
  |`DeEvent::Eof`|Renamed to `DeError::UnexpectedEof`
  |`DeError::EndOfAttributes`|Renamed to `DeError::KeyNotFound`
  |`DeError::ExpectedStart`|Added

- [#391]: Added code coverage

- [#393]: `event_namespace` and `attribute_namespace` now accept `QName`
  and returns `ResolveResult` and `LocalName`, `read_event_namespaced` now
  returns `ResolveResult` instead of `Option<[u8]>`
- [#393]: Types of `Attribute::key` and `Attr::key()` changed to `QName`
- [#393]: Now `BytesStart::name()` and `BytesEnd::name()` returns `QName`, and
  `BytesStart::local_name()` and `BytesEnd::local_name()` returns `LocalName`

- [#191]: Remove unused `reader.decoder().decode_owned()`. If you ever used it,
  use `String::from_utf8` instead (which that function did)
- [#191]: Remove `*_without_bom` methods from the `Attributes` struct because they are useless.
  Use the same-named methods without that suffix instead. Attribute values cannot contain BOM
- [#191]: Remove `Reader::decode()` and `Reader::decode_without_bom()`, they are replaced by
  `Decoder::decode()` and nothing.
  Use `reader.decoder().decode_*(...)` instead of `reader.decode_*(...)` for now.
  `Reader::encoding()` is replaced by `Decoder::encoding()` as well
- [#180]: Eliminated the differences in the decoding API when feature `encoding` enabled and when it is
  disabled. Signatures of functions are now the same regardless of whether or not the feature is
  enabled, and an error will be returned instead of performing replacements for invalid characters
  in both cases.

  Previously, if the `encoding` feature was enabled, decoding functions would return `Result<Cow<&str>>`
  while without this feature they would return `Result<&str>`. With this change, only `Result<Cow<&str>>`
  is returned regardless of the status of the feature.
- [#180]: Error variant `Error::Utf8` replaced by `Error::NonDecodable`

- [#118]: Remove `BytesStart::unescaped*` set of methods because they could return wrong results
  Use methods on `Attribute` instead

- [#403]: Remove deprecated `quick_xml::de::from_bytes` and `Deserializer::from_borrowing_reader`

- [#412]: Rename methods of `Reader`:
  |Old Name                 |New Name
  |-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------
  |`read_event`             |`read_event_into`
  |`read_to_end`            |`read_to_end_into`
  |`read_text`              |`read_text_into`
  |`read_event_unbuffered`  |`read_event`
  |`read_to_end_unbuffered` |`read_to_end`
- [#412]: Change `read_to_end*` and `read_text_into` to accept `QName` instead of `AsRef<[u8]>`

- [#415]: Changed custom entity unescaping API to accept closures rather than a mapping of entity to
  replacement text. This avoids needing to allocate a map and provides the user with more flexibility.
- [#415]: Renamed functions for consistency across the API:
  |Old Name                |New Name
  |------------------------|-------------------------------------------
  |`*_with_custom_entities`|`*_with`
  |`BytesText::unescaped()`|`BytesText::unescape()`
  |`Attribute::unescaped_*`|`Attribute::unescape_*`
- [#329]: Also, that functions now borrow from the input instead of event / attribute

- [#416]: `BytesStart::to_borrowed` renamed to `BytesStart::borrow`, the same method
  added to all events

- [#421]: `decode_and_unescape*` methods now does one less allocation if unescaping is not required
- [#421]: Removed ability to deserialize byte arrays from serde deserializer.
  XML is not able to store binary data directly, you should always use some encoding
  scheme, for example, HEX or Base64
- [#421]: All unescaping functions now accepts and returns strings instead of byte slices

- [#423]: All escaping functions now accepts and returns strings instead of byte slices
- [#423]: Removed `BytesText::from_plain` because it internally did escaping of a byte array,
  but since now escaping works on strings. Use `BytesText::new` instead

- [#428]: Removed `BytesText::escaped()`. Use `.as_ref()` provided by `Deref` impl instead.
- [#428]: Removed `BytesText::from_escaped()`. Use constructors from strings instead,
  because writer anyway works in UTF-8 only
- [#428]: Removed `BytesCData::new()`. Use constructors from strings instead,
  because writer anyway works in UTF-8 only
- [#428]: Changed the event and `Attributes` constructors to accept a `&str` slices instead of `&[u8]` slices.
  Handmade events has always been assumed to store their content UTF-8 encoded.
- [#428]: Removed `Decoder` parameter from `_and_decode` versions of functions for
  `BytesText` (remember, that those functions was renamed in #415).

- [#431]: Changed event constructors:
  |Old names                                         |New name
  |--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------
  |`BytesStart::owned_name(impl Into<Vec<u8>>)`      |`BytesStart::new(impl Into<Cow<str>>)`
  |`BytesStart::borrowed_name(&[u8])`                |_(as above)_
  |`BytesStart::owned(impl Into<Vec<u8>>, usize)`    |`BytesStart::from_content(impl Into<Cow<str>>, usize)`
  |`BytesStart::borrowed(&[u8], usize)`              |_(as above)_
  |`BytesEnd::owned(Vec<u8>)`                        |`BytesEnd::new(impl Into<Cow<str>>)`
  |`BytesEnd::borrowed(&[u8])`                       |_(as above)_
  |`BytesText::from_escaped(impl Into<Cow<[u8]>>)`   |`BytesText::from_escaped(impl Into<Cow<str>>)`
  |`BytesText::from_escaped_str(impl Into<Cow<str>>)`|_(as above)_
  |`BytesText::from_plain(&[u8])`                    |`BytesText::new(&str)`
  |`BytesText::from_plain_str(&str)`                 |_(as above)_
  |`BytesCData::new(impl Into<Cow<[u8]>>)`           |`BytesCData::new(impl Into<Cow<str>>)`
  |`BytesCData::from_str(&str)`                      |_(as above)_

- [#440]: Removed `Deserializer::from_slice` and `quick_xml::de::from_slice` methods because deserializing from a byte
  array cannot guarantee borrowing due to possible copying while decoding.

- [#455]: Removed `Reader::read_text_into` which is just a thin wrapper over match on `Event::Text`

- [#456]: Reader and writer stuff grouped under `reader` and `writer` modules.
  You still can use re-exported definitions from a crate root

- [#459]: Made the `Writer::write()` method non-public as writing random bytes to a document is not generally useful or desirable.
- [#459]: BOM bytes are no longer emitted as `Event::Text`. To write a BOM, use `Writer::write_bom()`.

- [#467]: Removed `Deserializer::new` because it cannot be used outside of the quick-xml crate

### New Tests

- [#9]: Added tests for incorrect nested tags in input
- [#387]: Added a bunch of tests for sequences deserialization
- [#393]: Added more tests for namespace resolver
- [#393]: Added tests for reserved names (started with "xml"i) -- see <https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/#xmlReserved>
- [#363]: Add tests for `Reader::read_event_impl` to ensure that proper events generated for corresponding inputs
- [#407]: Improved benchmark suite to cover whole-document parsing, escaping and unescaping text
- [#418]: Parameterized macrobenchmarks and comparative benchmarks, added throughput measurements via criterion
- [#434]: Added more tests for serde deserializer
- [#443]: Now all documents in `/tests/documents` are checked out with LF eol in working copy (except sample_5_utf16bom.xml)
